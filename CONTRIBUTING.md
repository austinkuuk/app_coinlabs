# Required Steps for Committing and Contributing

In order to contribute to this project, we require all developers to sign their commits using GPG. This is an important security measure that helps us verify the authenticity of the commits and prevent unauthorized modifications.

If you haven't already set up GPG commit signing, please follow the steps outlined in our [GPG Commit Signing Guide](https://www.notion.so/zeta-resource/Implementing-GPG-Commit-Signing-for-Enhanced-Security-in-GitHub-Projects-db8b24dac65a4dd1a224e6629dccbc5a)
. This guide provides detailed instructions for installing GPG and configuring it with GitHub, and it includes steps for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

Once you've set up GPG commit signing, you can start contributing to the project. Remember to sign all your commits. If a commit is not signed, it will not be accepted.

Thank you for helping us maintain the security and integrity of our project!
